# Coin-Counter
Created with CodeSandbox

This is calculates approximate dollar value of coins, as well as the number of paper wrappers needed to organize them into rolls, 
based on their weight. This can be claculated in either grams or pounds, but all weights must be given in the same unit type.

I imagine this could be useful for a variety of people who collect spare change, giving them an estimate of their savings without 
having to travel to another location like a bank or CoinStar machine.

Further functionality could still be added to give an error message when NaN values are calculated, as well as changing the styling 
to make it mobile-friendly.
